# FareSight - About
FareSight is an innovative application that leverages machine learning to predict high-demand taxi zones in New York City at any given time during the year, giving rideshare drivers a competitive edge to maximize their income. By analyzing historical ride data and its patterns, FareSight identifies the most lucrative zones for drivers at any given time, transforming guesswork into data-driven decisions.

# Tech Stack
<ul>
  <li>Machine Learning: Python and PyTorch for predictive modeling.</li>
  <li>Backend: FastAPI for high-performance, asynchronous API endpoints.</li>
  <li>Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript served via Pythonâ€™s HTTP server for lightweight zone visualization.</li>
  <li>Data Processing: Pandas/NumPy for handling and analyzing ride data.</li>
  <li>Environment: Python 3.8+, Uvicorn for ASGI server implementation.</li>
</ul>
